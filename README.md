# TOPSIS Implementation in Python for Multi-Criteria Decision Making

This project implements the **TOPSIS (Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution)** method using Python.  
The implementation is designed as a **command-line program** and ranks alternatives based on their closeness to the ideal best and ideal worst solutions.

## Output Description

The output is generated as a **CSV file** and also displayed on the terminal.

The output contains the following columns:
- **Alternatives** (from input file)
- **Topsis Score** (relative closeness to ideal solution)
- **Rank** (higher score → better rank)
